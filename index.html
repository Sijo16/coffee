          A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.
          It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a
          coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a
          so-called stone fruit. Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their
          energy and aid in harvesting,but can grow to more than 30 feet (9
          meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing
          opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the
          branches.Because it grows in a continuous cycle, it’s not unusual to
          see flowers,green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">
          There are 3 main types of coffee beans :
        </h2><br>
            <div id="deta"><span id="type-name">Robusta: </span>
            The next variety of coffee bean is Robusta, which is the second most
            produced in the world. As the name hints, the Robusta bean is both
            hardy and is also immune to a variety of diseases too. This type of
            coffee bean grows best in a hot climate with irregular rainfall and
            can grow at a number of altitudes too. Compared to Arabica beans,
            those that grow on the Robusta plant have double the amount of
            caffeine in them, meaning that they are an excellent choice for a
            real boost and offer a more harsh flavour. 
            <div class="coffee-pic"><img src="./cofeeimg/r1.jpg" alt="" width="190px" height="190px"></div>
          </div>
          </li>
          <br>
          
            <div id="deta1"><span id="type-name">Liberica:</span>
            One of the hardest types of coffee bean to come by is the Liberica bean.
            They are larger than the other beans and is the only one in the world that is known to have an irregular shape.
            Liberica beans are also unique in their aroma and some say that they are not only smoky,
            but they are fruity and floral too.

            <div class="coffee-pic"><img src="./cofeeimg/l1.jpg" alt="" width="190px" height="190px"></div>

          </li><br>
          
            <div id="deta2"><span id="type-name">Arabica:</span>Arabica beans are the most commonly produced variety and are considered higher quality beans.
            In fact, over 60% of the coffee beans in the world that are produced are Arabica variety.
            These beans are grown at high altitudes and need to be in an area that has a steady rainfall and plenty of shade.
            Perhaps one of the reasons that this is a variety of coffee bean that is seen the world over is because the trees are easy to care for,
            they are reasonably small and they are easy to prune too.

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Type of Roasts :</h2>
        <p><div id="det"><h3>Light Roast :</h3>Light roast coffee is usually roasted in a short amount of time,
          at lower temperatures compared to dark roasts. Usually between 350-400 degrees Fahrenheit to obtain light brown colored beans as result.
          Since lightly roasted beans are only roasted in a short amount of time,
          the coffee beans are left with more moisture inside, which is the reason why this type of coffee is denser.
          When it comes to light roasting, expect it to create a “cracking” noise known as the “first crack.
          It happens when the vapors or moistures inside the beans are forced to break through out of it. And to achieve that kind of consistency,
          coffee should not be further roasted beyond the first crack. 
          Lightly roasted coffees are more consumed by coffee lovers and even loved by many roasters around the globe.
          That is because of its ability to bring more flourishing and unique flavors to the taste.
          The good thing about this roast level is it simply highlights the coffee’s unique characteristics and unique origin.
          Also known as: Half-City, Cinnamon, New England Roast
        </div>
          <div id="coff-pic"><a href="#"><img src="./cofeeimg/ls1.jpg" alt=""  width="300px" height="250px"></a></div>
        </p>
        <p><div id="det1"><h3>Medium Roast :</h3>Medium roasted coffees are medium brown in color. The roasting temperatures reach 
          between 410-428 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain a body like that’s more of a light roast but less of a dark roast.
          It’s just basically roasted to a certain point between light and dark roast coffee to obtain a perfectly balanced flavor, the acidity, sweetness, and so on. 
          Just like a lighter roast, the beans may have no oil but have slightly caramelized sugars on the surfaces.
          You can still taste some unique characteristics and the rich sweetness of the beans.
          So, if you’re looking for a balanced flavor, you don’t like the taste of light nor dark roast coffees,
          then try to roast your beans in this kind of category – the medium roast coffee.
          Also known as: City Roast, Regular, American

        <div id="coff-pic1"><a href="#"><img src="./cofeeimg/mr1.jpg" alt=""  width="300px" height="250px"></a></div>
        <p><div id="det2"><h3>Dark Roast :</h3>Dark roast coffee stays in the roasting process for a longer time at a higher temperature.
          Usually, the temperature reaches between 430-450 degrees Fahrenheit to reach that “second crack”.
          Typically, it is just the continuation of light and medium roasts to further develop the flavors.
          And should not to be roasted beyond that second crack to obtain dark brown or even darker colored beans, as a preferred result. 
          In terms of density, the beans at this roast profile are less dense compared to the other ones.
          The more you continue roasting your coffee beans, the more moistures you lose in it, which makes the beans less dense. 
          Also known as: Heavy Roast, French, Dark French, Espresso, Turkish, Italian
